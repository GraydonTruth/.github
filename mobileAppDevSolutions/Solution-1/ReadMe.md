# Solution 1: Node.js + Express.js (Backend) & React Native (Frontend)

This solution demonstrates a full-stack JavaScript mobile application using **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend, and **React Native** for the cross-platform mobile frontend.

## Folder Structure

solution-1/ ├── backend/ │ └── server.js # Node.js + Express.js backend └── frontend/ └── App.js # React Native frontend



## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **React Native CLI** installed globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g react-native-cli
    ```

- **Android Studio/Xcode** for mobile development (to run on Android/iOS simulators or physical devices).

## Backend Setup (Node.js + Express.js)

1. **Navigate to the `backend` directory**:

   cd backend
Install dependencies:


Copy code
npm install
Run the backend:


Copy code
npm start
The server will run at http://localhost:3000. Test it by opening your browser and going to http://localhost:3000/.

Frontend Setup (React Native)
Navigate to the frontend directory:


Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:


Copy code
npm install
Run the React Native app:


Copy code
react-native run-android   # for Android devices
react-native run-ios       # for iOS devices
Test the app on an emulator or a real device connected to your computer.

Environment Variables
For environment configuration (API keys, database URLs), create a .env file in the root of the backend and frontend folders.
